# 🎯 Hi-Low Trivia – NES Style

Welcome to **Hi-Low Trivia**, the third game in my 90s Nintendo-style browser game collection!  
Following the success of **Hangman NES Edition** and **NES Crossword**, this game challenges players with fast-paced trivia questions — but with a twist:  
you win by **guessing the correct number range**.
